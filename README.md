# DataStructures & Algorithms
    
   This repo covers the Basics of Datastructures & Algorithms solved on my own and i have learned.
    Here you can find the sections i have started solving on HackerRank website.

# Algorithms Problem Solving - Princeton University

   In this sections i have started solving the problems/assignments from princeton university it has two parts Algorithm1, Algorithm2 and week by week schedule
   
   #Algorithm 1 
   
   Week 1: 
   Union Find
      1.assignment
      2.creative problems
      3.excercises
      4.web excercises
      
   Analysis of Algorithms
      
   Week 2: Stacks and Queues
   
   #Algorithm 2
   
      

# Special Algorithms - used on jobs

  This repo will covers what ever the critical/special/different algorithms used on my career

    1.HyperLogLog(I)
