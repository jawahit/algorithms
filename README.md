# Algorithms Problem Solving - Princeton University

   In this sections i have started solving the problems/assignments from princeton university it has two parts Algorithm1, Algorithm2      and week by week schedule
   
       -> Algorithm 1 

       Week 1: (C)
       Union Find
          1.assignment
          2.creative problems
          3.excercises
          4.web excercises

       Analysis of Algorithms

       Week 2: Stacks and Queues

       -> Algorithm 2
   
      

# Special Algorithms - used on jobs

  This repo will covers the critical/special/different algorithms used on my career

    1.HyperLogLog(I)
